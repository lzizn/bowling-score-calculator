# Bowling Game Score Problem

### Proposal

Calculate score of a **single** bowling game.

### Basics

Bowling is a game where we have some pints and we throw the balls to knock most pins as we can over some rounds.

### Rules:

- Game has 10 rounds;
- On each round, you can knock down up to 10 pins;
- On each round you have two throws;
- If in one throw the amount of pins is smaller than 10, you have another chance to knock down the remaining pins.

### Pontuation details:

> A slash **_/_** is called a Spare. When a spare happens, the amount of bonus points is the amount of knocked pins on the NEXT throw.

> An **_X_** is a strike. When a strike happens, the amount of bonus points is the amount of knocked pins on the next TWO THROWS. You can have several strikes in a row.
